*commit in progress

Game created in Godot, pixel art created in Piskel. 

Final project with these requirements: original graphics, main menu, one level, 5 minutes of gameplay, a playable character that can run and jump, win/loss conditions, three types of obstacles, and basic audio. 

Developers:
Lucy Hinck: Sprite visibility/animations for each of the horses & their run/jump/hit movement states utilizing AnimationPlayer & global variables, obstacles’ collision, menu screens, coin value updates, parallax, pre-race countdown & race timer, implementing sound & sprites, and fixed bugs & addressed playtesting feedback. I also created the task list, managed the task sprints, and led beta-testing. 
Cali Engel-Dempsey: Designs for three horses, their animation states (run, jump, idle, & hit), all race background components, located the font & color pallete, and asisted with AnimationPlayer & coin code debugging. 
Leah Woodward: Main menu background, barn background, all obstacle sprites, music, sound effects, coin design, and wrote game summary.

Game Summary:
In Twinkie’s Wild Ride, you play as Twinkie the horse, maneuvering through different obstacles, collecting as many coins as you can, while going through the course as fast as you can. Avoid the slithering snakes, leap over the shinny ponds, plastic bags, bunnies, and jump over various challenging jumps, all while racing the timer. You can get a time bonus depending on how fast you can get through the course. Then, by collecting a certain amount of coins,  you can purchase additional horses, either Blossom or Luna. Twinkie’s Wild Ride is a western-inspired world that involves fast-paced action and is replayable to get a better time.
